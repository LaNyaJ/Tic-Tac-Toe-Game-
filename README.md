Hey, this is a simple tic tac toe game with some razzle dazzle of style and music. Be entertained as you and/or another play tic tac toe.

## Introduction

For anyone who doesn't know tic tac toe, you and another player choose who is X or O and you place them on the board of 9 squares or boxes. First one to get 3 in a row win or draw if no one gets 3 in a row. 
The music (Soulful Groove) being played is my friend's mix he made from the app called Groovepad on mobile phone.

## Game Play

One player is X and the other is O. You pick where you want to place your X or O until one player wins or there is a draw by filling all the squares with no one getting 3 in a row.

## Rules:

Rules are self-explanantory since this is a simple 3 in a row game. Try to get 3 in a row in any way (diagonal, horizontal, or vertical) without the other player blocking you.
